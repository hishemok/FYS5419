    "The usual model of quantum computation is expressed in terms of qubits and Pauli operators $X$ $Y$ and $Z$. A single fermionic mode is also a two-level system (either occupied or not), but is quite different from a qubit. Two key features are fermionic parity conservation and the anti-commutation relations. \n",

    "Parity conservation means that we can't make superpositions between states of even and odd fermionic numbers. Therefore, a single fermionic mode can't be used as a qubit. It is a two-level system, but we are not allowed to make superpostions between the two states.\n",

The Hilbert space is 4-dimensional, but because of parity conservation, we can consider the two subspaces of even and odd total parity separately. Let's take the odd parity subspace to be concrete. This is a two level system, spanned by the states $\\ket{+ -}$ (left mode is unoccupied (even parity) and the right mode is occupied (odd parity)) and $\\ket{ - +}$. We can write down the standard Pauli operators in this space, i.e $X = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 &1\\\\1&0 \\end{pmatrix}$.\n",
